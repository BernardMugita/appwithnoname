        Data Management
        </h4>
        <p className=" p-4">
        When you upload your PDF statement, it is sent to our server for processing. Your file is stored securely and is only accessible to authorized personnel. We do not share your data with any third parties.
        </p>
        <h4>
        Data Processing
        </h4>
        <p className=" p-4">
        When you click 'start data processing', your code is used to unlock the statement. The server converts your PDF to a CSV file with readable data and alerts you when the process is completed. When you click 'Show me the money', data is read from the CSV file in the server and sent to you. When the server confirms data reading is successful, it deletes all your files (CSV and PDF).

        <h4>
